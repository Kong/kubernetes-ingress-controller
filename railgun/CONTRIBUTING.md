# Enhancements

Documenting and communicating the motivation for major enhancements in the Kong Kubernetes Ingress Controller (KIC) is done using an upstream Kubernetes process referred to as [Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals (KEPs)][kep].

## New Enhancement Proposals

When starting a new enhancement proposal use the upstream [KEP Template][template] file as the starting point for your KEP, and follow the instructions therein.

Initially you can remove a lot of the scaffolding in the template for the first `provisional` iteration and focus on establishing the following sections:

- Summary
- Motivation
- Goals
- User Stories

In general the maintainers here feel establishing these things in a KEP should be done _prior to any technical writeups_ but this is a soft rule.
