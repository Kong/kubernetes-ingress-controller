          KongServiceFacade allows creating separate Kong Services for a single Kubernetes
          Service. It can be used as Kubernetes Ingress' backend (via its path's `backend.resource`
          field). It's designed to enable creating two "virtual" Services in Kong that will point
          to the same Kubernetes Service, but will have different configuration (e.g. different
          set of plugins, different load balancing algorithm, etc.).


          KongServiceFacade requires `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation with a value
          matching the ingressClass of the Kong Ingress Controller (`kong` by default) to be reconciled.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
