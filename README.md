# Kong Ingress Controller for Kubernetes (KIC)

Use [Kong][kong] for Kubernetes [Gateway API][gwapi] or [Ingress][ingress].
Configure [plugins][docs-konghq-hub], health checking,
load balancing and more, all using
Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Kubernetes-native tooling.

## Features

- **Gateway API support (beta, soon GA)**
  Use [Gateway API][gwapi] resources (official successor of [Ingress][ingress] resources) to configure Kong.
  Native support for TCP, UDP, TLS, gRPC and HTTP/HTTPS traffic, reuse the same gateway for multiple protocols and namespaces.
- **Ingress support**
  Use [Ingress][ingress] resources to configure Kong.
- **Declarative configuration for Kong**
  Configure all of Kong features in declarative Kubernetes native way with CRDs.
- **Seamlessly operate Kong**
  Scale and manage multiple replicas of Kong Gateway automatically to ensure performance and high-availability.
- **Health checking and load-balancing**
  Load balance requests across your pods and supports active & passive health-checks.
- **Enhanced API management using plugins**
  Use a wide array of [plugins][docs-konghq-hub] for e.g.
  - authentication
  - request/response transformations
  - rate-limiting

## Get started

You can use [Minikube or Kind][k8s-io-tools] on your local machine or use
a hosted Kubernetes service like [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).

Setting up Kong for Kubernetes is as simple as:

```shell
# Install the Gateway API CRDs before installing Kong Ingress Controller.
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0-rc2/standard-install.yaml
# Install the Kong Ingress Controller with Helm.
helm repo add kong https://charts.konghq.com
helm repo update
helm install kong/ingress --generate-name
```
