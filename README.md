## Get started

You can deploy Kong Ingress Controller on any
Kubernetes cluster which supports a Service of `type: LoadBalancer`.

You can use
[Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/)
on your local machine or use
a hosted k8s service like
[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).

To setup Kong Ingress Controller in your k8s cluster, execute:

```shell
# using YAMLs
kubectl apply -f https://bit.ly/kong-ingress

# or using Helm
helm install stable/kong --set ingressController.enabled=true
```

You can also spin up Kong Ingress Controller without a database dependency:

```
# using YAMLs
kubectl apply -f https://bit.ly/kong-ingress-dbless
# or using Helm
helm install stable/kong --set ingressController.enabled=true \
  --set postgresql.enabled=false --set env.database=off
```

It takes a few minutes for all components to
spin up.
You now have set up Kong as your Ingress controller and
all Ingress resources in your Kubernetes Cluster will be satisfied.

Please refer to our [deployment documentation][deployment]
for a detailed introduction to Kong Ingress Controller
and Ingress spec.

:warning: Kong Ingress Controller takes care of managing all entities in Kong's
datastore as per the Ingress and custom resource definitions in k8s.
Any entity created using Kong's Admin API will be
deleted by the Ingress Controller.
