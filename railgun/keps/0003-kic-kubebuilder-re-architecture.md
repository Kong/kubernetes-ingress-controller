## Summary

Historically the [Kong Kubernetes Ingress Controller (KIC)][kic] was built on older Kubernetes controller design patterns and maintained a lot of functionality for the runtime of the controller. We will modernize the KIC by re-architecting it using the [Kubebuilder SDK][kb] provided by [Kubernetes Special Interest Groups (SIGs)][sig] and make more extensive use of the [controller-runtime][cr] and other upstream libraries to maintain [controllers][ctrl].

[sig]:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/
[cr]:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime
[ctrl]:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/

## Motivation

- increase the speed and efficiency for contributors adding new APIs
- decrease the complexity of interwoven dependencies between disparate APIs
- improve statuses and events associated with our APIs and improve the logging within their controller(s)
- provide separate controllers for each upstream API which we support (e.g. `netv1.Ingress`, `netv1beta1.Ingress`, e.t.c.)
- provide automation and tooling to generate and maintain multiple API implementations
- provide automation and tooling to maintain multiple API versions (e.g. `v1alpha1`, `v1beta1`, `v1`, e.t.c.)
- provide feature gates which limits access to newer and experimental Kubernetes APIs and controllers
- provide documentation for feature gates which communicates API maturity and longevity to end-users
- prepare ourselves for an eventual pivot to [Gateway APIs][gw]

### Goals

- re-architect KIC onto Kubebuilder and modern `controller-runtime`
- break the existing functionality related to each of our Kubernetes APIs (e.g. `KongIngress`, `TCPIngress`, e.t.c.) into their own [controller implementation][impl]
- produce `UDPIngress` to provide a starting point example of how to build and maintain APIs going forward

[impl]:https://kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/controller-overview.html

### Non-Goals

We reference [UDPIngress][udpingress] in the implementation history (below) as it was used for demonstration, but completing new features and APIs is not in scope for this KEP, though the result of this KEP is that newer features are intended to be easier to contribute.

We can use the improvements made here to _demonstrate_ the ease of adding new features on the new architecture, but the full scope of GA for new features will need to be a follow up KEP.

## Proposal

The historical releases of the KIC (which we will refer to as `pre-v2`) were built on an older controller architecture forked from the [NGinx Ingress Controller][nginx-ingress-controller] some years prior.

This legacy served us well for the years to come, but at the point where this KEP was written (early 2021) it was becoming noticeably harder to continue maintaining and adding new features to the KIC as it fundamentally hadn't grown alongside much of the rest of the Kubernetes open source community.

Since the inception of KIC new Software Development Kits (SDK) have been created to support building and maintaining Kubernetes controllers:

- [Kubebuilder][kb]
- [OperatorSDK][osdk]

These SDKs simplify, automate and ultimately generate some of the code we had been historically maintaining ourselves including (but not limited to):

- API schemas
- Controller reconcilation machinery
- Custom Resource Defition (CRD) management
- Kustomize configurations
- RBAC security
- controller-manager CLI (and flags)

In short, using a Kubernetes SDK gets most of the actual machinery and scaffolding needed to start writing our explicit API reconcilation logic for "free" (paid for by the last few years of community contributions, which we are extremely grateful for).

This enhancement is about re-architecting the KIC onto [Kubebuilder][kb] (for reasons why we did not choose [Redhat's OperatorSDK][osdk] see the [alternatives section below](/#alternatives) and as a consequence putting ourselves on a modern version of [Kubernetes Controller Runtime][cr] with a multitude of new enhancements and features.

The result will be a large portion of our KIC maintainence is automated (and possibly for some things even automated via CI) making it easier and faster to contribute to the project so that we can focus harder on fixes and enhancements.

### User Stories

#### Story 1

As a maintainer of KIC I want functionality concerns regarding our APIs clearly delimited between API boundaries and their controllers for simpler maintainance.

#### Story 2

As an operator of the KIC I want logging to be clearly deliniated by the responsible APIs/Controllers for improved transparency and readability.

#### Story 3

As a contributor to the KIC I want to be able to quickly contribute new ideas and experimental features without making them immediately available in upcoming releases.

#### Story 4

As a user of KIC, I want to be able to inspect the intermediate objects produced by KIC (collected KongState, generated decK config) for debugging purposes, as inspired by [this review comment](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/991#pullrequestreview-570627606).

## Implementation History

- spike and prototype started to re-architect the KIC and move it to modern tooling: https://github.com/kong/railgun
- merging the railgun prototype (KIC on [controller-runtime][cr] v0.7.x+ and [kubebuilder][kb]) into upstream [KIC][kic] (PR [KIC#1032][rgpr])
- developed a prototype [Kubernetes Testing Framework (KTF)][ktf] for KIC now used in railgun
- KIC 2.0 signed off by product for prioritization
- [KIC 2.0 Milestone established][ms12]
- [UDPIngress][udp] supported added to `railgun/` POC and demoed
- [Established KIC 2.0 Preview release criteria][ms15]
- KTF fully separated into it's [own repo][ktf]
- integration tests [added][legacy-tests] to test `v1.x` and railgun controllers on every PR from now until release

## Alternatives

The [OperatorSDK][osdk] from [Redhat][rhel] was considered for our new Kubernetes SDK, but ultimately decided against due to lack of familiarity and preferring a more generic and flexible toolkit.
