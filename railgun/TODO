* we need to fix upstream KIC types for generators
  - https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/pkg/apis/configuration/v1/types.go#L165
  - we need to change OR provider a Getter()/Setter() wrapper for Healthchecks (float64 not supported in controller-gen)
* implement downward API for namespace awareness in controller pods to enable multi-namespace functionality
  - FIXME: right now make manifests isn't working (see above) need to fix that first
  - https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/blob/main/kong/types.go#L160
  - https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/issues/245
* implement the remaining inputs controllers (shane)
* implement the secret controller in controllers/configuration
  - import upstream KIC parser
  - need a label setup to locate all proxy instances

follow up scope items (for after POC):
* we're still considering making this a custom API (CRD) instead of a secret
* need mTLS for proxy configuration
  - consider the mTLS controller from the other POC
