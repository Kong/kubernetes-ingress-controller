# Feature Preview Documentation

This document partners with the [feature gates documentation][fg] and includes early draft documentation for features that are currently considered [alpha maturity][fg-alpha].

As features mature to `BETA` or `GA` state this documentation will be grown and eventually will graduate to the [main Kong Documentation][kong-docs].

**WARNING**: the documentation here should be considered experimental and for development use. DO NOT USE FOR PRODUCTION.
