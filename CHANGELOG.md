## [0.1.1] - 2018/09/26

#### Fixed

   [#141](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/141)

## [0.2.0] - 2018/09/21

#### Breaking Changes

 - :warning: Support for Kong 0.13.x has been dropped in favor of 0.14.x

#### Deprecated

 - :warning: Configuring plugins in Kong using `<plugin-name>.plugin.konghq.com`
 annotation is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
 Please use `plugins.konghq.com` annotation instead.

#### Added

 - **Support for Kong 0.14.x** The supported version of Kong 0.14.x
   has been introduced. Kong 0.14.x introduced breaking changes to a few
   Admin API endpoints which have been updated in the Ingress Controller.
   [#101](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/101)
 - **Global Plugins** Plugins can be configured to run globally in Kong
   using a "global" label on `KongPlugin` resource.
   [#112](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/112)
 - A new property `plugin` has been introduced in `KongPlugin` resource
   which ties the configuration to be used and the type of the plugin.
   [#122](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/122)
 - Multiple plugins can be configured for an Ingress or a Service in k8s
   using `plugins.konghq.com` annotation.
   [#124](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/124)
 - `KongPlugin` resources do not need to be duplicated any more.
   The same `KongPlugin` resource can be used across
   multiple Ingress/Service resources.
   [#121](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/121)
 - The custom resource definitions now have a shortname for all the
   CRDs, making it easy to interract with `kubectl`.
   [#120](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/120)

#### Fixed

 - Avoid issuing unnecessary PATCH requests on Services in Kong during the
   reconcillation loop, which lead to unnecessary Router rebuilds inside Kong.
   [#107](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/107)
 - Fixed the diffing logic for plugin configuration between KongPlugin
   resource in k8s and plugin config in Kong to avoid false positives.
   [#106](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/106)
 - Correctly format IPv6 address for Targets in Kong.
   Thanks @NixM0nk3y for the patch!
