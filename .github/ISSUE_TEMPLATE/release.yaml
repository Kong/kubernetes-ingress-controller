    label: "**For all releases** Github Workflow Test Matrix Checkup"
    options:
      - label: Check the testing workflow ([.github/workflows/_integration_tests.yaml](/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/.github/workflows/_integration_tests.yaml)) and ensure that all matrix versions ([.github/workflows/_e2e_tests.yaml](/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/.github/workflows/_e2e_tests.yaml) (for both K8s and Istio with K8s matrix) and [.github/workflows/release.yaml](/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml))  are up to date for various component releases. If there have been any new releases (major, minor or patch) of those components since the latest version seen in that configuration make sure the new versions get added before proceeding with the release. Remove any versions that are no longer supported by the environment provider.
      - label: Kubernetes (via [KIND](https://hub.docker.com/r/kindest/node/tags) and the latest image available when creating a new rapid channel cluster from the GKE new cluster wizard)
      - label: Istio (via [Istio's releases page](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases))

  attributes:
    label: "Bump Kong Gateway version in manifests"
    options:
      - label: "Note: it might be possible that the latest Gateway version is not compatible with KIC and code changes are required. In such case, a decision whether to release with no compliance with the latest Gateway version should be made on a team level."
      - label: Check the latest minor Kong Gateway release in [Kong releases](https://github.com/Kong/kong/releases).
      - label: Make sure the image tag in [config/image/enterprise/kustomization.yaml](/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/config/image/enterprise/kustomization.yaml) and [config/image/oss/kustomization.yaml](/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/config/image/oss/kustomization.yaml) is updated accordingly.
      - label: Run `make manifests` to regenerate manifests using the modified kustomizations and open a PR with the changes (similarly to [this PR](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3288)).

  id: release_branch

    label: "**For major/minor releases** Create `release/<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.x` Branch"
    options:
      # This can be automated. https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/3772 tracks this effort
      - label: "Create the `release/<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.x` branch at the place where you want to branch of off main"

  id: prepare_release_branch
  attributes:
    label: "**For all releases** Create `prepare-release/x.y.z` Branch"
    options:
      - label: "Ensure that you have up to date copy of `main`: `git checkout main; git pull` or a targeted release branch e.g. `release/2.7.x`: `git checkout release/2.7.x; git pull`"
      - label: "Create the `prepare-release` branch for the version (e.g. `prepare-release/2.7.1`): `git branch -m prepare-release/2.7.1`"
      - label: Make any final adjustments to CHANGELOG.md. Double-check that dates are correct, that link anchors point to the correct header, and that you've included a link to the Github compare link at the end. If there were any RC releases before this version, fold their changes into the final release entry.
      - label: Resolve all licensing issues that FOSSA has detected. Go to Issues tab in FOSSA's KIC project and resolve every issue, inspecting if it's a false positive or not. [ignored.go](https://github.com/Kong/team-k8s/blob/main/fossa/ignored.go) script should be useful to look for issues that have been already resolved and reappeared due to version changes.
      - label: Update [ignored.json](https://github.com/Kong/team-k8s/blob/main/fossa/kubernetes-ingress-controller/ignored.json) following instructions in [README](https://github.com/Kong/team-k8s/blob/main/fossa/README.md).
      - label: Retrieve the latest license report from FOSSA and save it to LICENSES (go to Reports tab in FOSSA's KIC project, select 'plain text' format, tick 'direct dependencies' and download it).
      - label: "Ensure base manifest versions use the new version (`config/image/enterprise/kustomization.yaml` and `config/image/oss/kustomization.yaml`) and update manifest files: `make manifests`"

    label: "**For all releases** Create a Release Pull Request"
    options:
      - label: Check the [latest E2E nightly test run](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/actions/workflows/e2e_nightly.yaml) to confirm that E2E tests are succeeding. If you are backporting features into a non-main branch, run a [targeted E2E job against that branch](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/actions/workflows/e2e_targeted.yaml) or use `ci/run-e2e` label on the PR preparing the release.
      - label: Open a PR from your branch to `main`. Set a `backport release/X.Y.Z` label.
      - label: If this is a patch release, ensure that the release branch (e.g. `release/2.9.x`) compared against the latest patch for this minor release (e.g. `v2.9.0`) includes the expected changes that the release should include (e.g. by checking [https://github.com/kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/compare/v2.9.0..release/2.9.x](https://github.com/kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/compare/v2.9.0..release/2.9.x)).
      - label: Once the PR is merged (the `prepare-release/x.y.z` branch will get automatically removed), approve and merge the automatic backport PR and [initiate a release job](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/actions/workflows/release.yaml) on the release branch. Your tag must use `vX.Y.Z` format. Set `latest` to true if this will be the latest release.
      - label: CI will validate the requested version, build and push an image, and run tests against the image before finally creating a tag and publishing a release. If tests fail, CI will push the image but not the tag or release. Investigate the failure, correct it as needed, and start a new release job.

  id: release_documents
  attributes:
    label: "**For major/minor releases only** Update Release documents"
    options:
      - label: Trigger [release_docs](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/.github/workflows/release_docs.yaml) workflow. Note that you will need to update the new version's navigation manifest (e.g. [for 2.7](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/main/app/_data/docs_nav_kic_2.7.x.yml) to use the new file after.
      - label: Ensure a draft PR is created in [docs.konghq.com](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pulls) repository.
      - label: Update articles in the new version as needed.
      - label: Update `references/version-compatibility.md` to include the new versions (make sure you capture any new Kubernetes/Istio versions that have been tested)
      - label: Copy `app/_data/docs_nav_kic_OLDVERSION.yml` to `app/_data/docs_nav_kic_NEWVERSION.yml` and update the `release` field to `NEWVERSION`. Add entries for any new articles.
      - label: Make sure that `app/_data/docs_nav_kic_NEWVERSION.yml` links to the latest generated `custom-resources-X.X.X.md`.
      - label: Add a section to `app/_data/kong_versions.yml` for your version.
      - label: "Add entries in support policy documents: `app/_includes/md/support-policy.md` and `app/_src/kubernetes-ingress-controller/support-policy.md`."
      - label: Mark the PR ready for review.
      - label: Inform and ping the @team-k8s via slack of impending release with a link to the release PR.
