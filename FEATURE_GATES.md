# Feature Gates

Upstream [Kubernetes][k8s] includes [Feature Gates][gates] to enable or disable features with flags and track the maturity of a feature using [Feature Stages][stages]. Here in the Kubernetes Ingress Controller (KIC) we use the same definitions of `Feature Gates` and `Feature Stages` from upstream Kubernetes, but with our own list of features.

Using `Feature Gates` enables contributors to add and manage new (and potentially) experimental functionality to the KIC in a controlled manner: the features will be "hidden" until generally available (GA) and the progress and maturity of features on their path to GA will be documented. Feature gates also create a clear path for deprecating features.

See below for current features and their statuses, and follow the links to the relevant feature documentation.

## Feature gates

Below you will find the overviews of features at various maturity levels:

- [Feature gates for graduated or deprecated features](#feature-gates-for-graduated-or-deprecated-features)
- [Feature gates for Alpha or Beta features](#feature-gates-for-alpha-or-beta-features)

Please read the [Important Notes](#important-notes) section before using any `Alpha` or `Beta` features.

### Important notes

- Most features will be planned and detailed using [Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals (KEP)][k8s-kep]: If you're interested in the development side of features familiarize yourself with our [KEPs][kic-keps]
- The `Since` and `Until` rows in below tables refer to [KIC Releases][releases]
- For `GA` features the documentation exists in the main [Kong Documentation][kong-docs], see the [API reference][api-ref] and [Guides][kic-guides]

An additional **warning** for end-users who are reading this documentation and trying to enable `Alpha` or `Beta` features: it is **very important** to understand that features that are currently in an `Alpha` or `Beta` state may **become `Deprecated` at any time** and **may be removed as part of the next consecutive minor release**. This is especially true for `Alpha` maturity features. In other words, **until a feature becomes GA there are no guarantees that it's going to continue being available**. To avoid disruption to your services engage with the community and read the [CHANGELOG](/CHANGELOG.md) carefully to track progress. Alternatively **do not use features until they have reached a GA status**.

### Documentation

If you're looking for documentation for `Alpha` maturity features you can find feature preview documentation [here in this repo](/FEATURE_PREVIEW_DOCUMENTATION.md).

Once a feature graduates from `Alpha` to `Beta` maturity these preview docs will be moved to the main [Kong Documentation][kong-docs].

### Feature gates for graduated or deprecated features

{{< table caption="Feature Gates for Graduated or Deprecated Features" >}}

| Feature                    | Default | Stage      | Since | Until |
|----------------------------|---------|------------|-------|-------|

{{< /table >}}

Features that reach GA and over time become stable will be removed from this table, they can be found in the main [KIC CRD Documentation][specs] and [Guides][guides].
