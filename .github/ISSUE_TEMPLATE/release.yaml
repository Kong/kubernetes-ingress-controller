    options:
      - label: check the testing workflow ([.github/workflows/test.yaml](/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yaml)) and ensure that all matrix versions ([.github/workflows/e2e.yaml](/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/.github/workflows/e2e.yaml) and [.github/workflows/release.yaml](/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml))  are up to date for various component releases. If there have been any new releases (major, minor or patch) of those components since the latest version seen in that configuration make sure the new versions get added before proceeding with the release. Remove any versions that are no longer supported by the environment provider.

      - label: Check the [latest nightly job](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/actions/workflows/nightly.yaml) to confirm that E2E is succeeding. If you are backporting features into a non-main branch, run a [targeted E2E job against that branch](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/actions/workflows/e2e_targeted.yaml).
      - label: Open a PR from your branch to `main`.
      - label: Once the PR is merged, [initiate a release job](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/actions/workflows/release.yaml). Your tag must use `vX.Y.Z` format. Set `latest` to true if this will be the latest release.
      - label: CI will validate the requested version, build and push an image, and run tests against the image before finally creating a tag and publishing a release. If tests fail, CI will push the image but not the tag or release. Investigate the failure, correct it as needed, and start a new release job.
