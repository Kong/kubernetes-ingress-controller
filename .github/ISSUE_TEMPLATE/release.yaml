    label: "**For all releases** Github Workflow Test Matrix Checkup"
    options:
      - label: check the testing workflow ([.github/workflows/test.yaml](/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yaml)) and ensure that all matrix versions ([.github/workflows/e2e.yaml](/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/.github/workflows/e2e.yaml) and [.github/workflows/release.yaml](/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml))  are up to date for various component releases. If there have been any new releases (major, minor or patch) of those components since the latest version seen in that configuration make sure the new versions get added before proceeding with the release. Remove any versions that are no longer supported by the environment provider.
      - label: Kubernetes (via [KIND](https://hub.docker.com/r/kindest/node/tags) and the latest image available when creating a new rapid channel cluster from the GKE new cluster wizard)

  attributes:
    label: "Bump Kong Gateway version in manifests"
    options:
      - label: "Note: it might be possible that the latest Gateway version is not compatible with KIC and code changes are required. In such case, a decision whether to release with no compliance with the latest Gateway version should be made on a team level."
      - label: Check the latest minor Kong Gateway release in [Kong releases](https://github.com/Kong/kong/releases).
      - label: Make sure the image tag in `config/image/enterprise/kustomization.yaml`, `config/image/oss/kustomization.yaml`, and `config/variants/enterprise/kustomization.yaml` is updated accordingly.
      - label: Run `make manifests` to regenerate manifests using the modified kustomizations and open a PR with the changes (similarly to [this PR](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3288)).
- type: checkboxes
  id: release_branch
  attributes:
    label: "**For all releases** Create Release Branch"
    options:
      - label: "ensure that you have up to date copy of `main`: git checkout main; git pull"
      - label: "create the release branch for the version (e.g. `release/1.3.1`): `git branch -m release/x.y.z`"
      - label: Make any final adjustments to CHANGELOG.md. Double-check that dates are correct, that link anchors point to the correct header, and that you've included a link to the Github compare link at the end.
      - label: Resolve all licensing issues that FOSSA has detected. Go to Issues tab in FOSSA's KIC project and resolve every issue, inspecting if it's a false positive or not. [ignored.go](https://github.com/Kong/team-k8s/blob/main/fossa/ignored.go) script should be useful to look for issues that have been already resolved and reappeared due to version changes.
      - label: Update [ignored.json](https://github.com/Kong/team-k8s/blob/main/fossa/kubernetes-ingress-controller/ignored.json) following instructions in [README](https://github.com/Kong/team-k8s/blob/main/fossa/README.md).
      - label: Retrieve the latest license report from FOSSA and save it to LICENSES (go to Reports tab in FOSSA's KIC project, select 'plain text' format, tick 'direct dependencies' and download it).
      - label: "ensure base manifest versions use the new version (`config/image/enterprise/kustomization.yaml` and `config/image/oss/kustomization.yaml`) and update manifest files: `make manifests`"

- type: checkboxes
  id: release_pr
  attributes:
    label: "**For all releases** Create a Release Pull Request"
    options:
      - label: Check the [latest test run](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/actions/workflows/e2e.yaml) to confirm that E2E tests are succeeding. If you are backporting features into a non-main branch, run a [targeted E2E job against that branch](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/actions/workflows/e2e_targeted.yaml).
      - label: Open a PR from your branch to `main`.
      - label: Once the PR is merged, [initiate a release job](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/actions/workflows/release.yaml). Your tag must use `vX.Y.Z` format. Set `latest` to true if this will be the latest release.
      - label: CI will validate the requested version, build and push an image, and run tests against the image before finally creating a tag and publishing a release. If tests fail, CI will push the image but not the tag or release. Investigate the failure, correct it as needed, and start a new release job.

      - label: Verify the image was pushed by a pipeline to the [KIC project in Red Hat partners portal](https://connect.redhat.com/projects/5eab1b8ea165648bd1353266/images) to confirm that E2E tests are succeeding. If you are backporting features into a non-main branch, run a [targeted E2E job against that branch](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/actions/workflows/e2e_targeted.yaml).
      - label: Click publish button for all tags related to the release that were pushed to the portal. That will publish the image to Red Hat Catalog.

    options:
      - label: Trigger [release_docs](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/.github/workflows/release_docs.yaml) workflow. Note that you will need to update the new version's navigation manifest (e.g. [for 2.7](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/main/app/_data/docs_nav_kic_2.7.x.yml) to use the new file after.
      - label: Ensure a draft PR is created in [docs.konghq.com](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pulls) repository.
      - label: Update articles in the new version as needed.
