      # TODO: Previously we've used kong/kong:amd64-latest but that image reports
      # its version (through AdminAPI / endpoint) as SHA instead of a semver.
      # This breaks KIC's Admin root configuration verification on startup.
      # To unblock this, we're switching to kong/kong-gateway-dev:nightly because
      # it reports the next release to be released as semver in the version field.
