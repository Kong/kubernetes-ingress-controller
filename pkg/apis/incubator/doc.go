// Package incubator contains API Schema definitions for the incubator.ingress-controller.konghq.com API group.
// This group is for APIs that are highly experimental and may not be supported in the future.
// It's not distributed by default and has to be installed separately.
//
// CRDs in this group are not going to graduate to beta or GA in scope of the group.
// They're unlikely to be promoted to the `configuration.konghq.com` group, but if they do,
// this will be the way for them to be promoted to beta or GA.
//
// Deprecated: API types were migrated to github.com/kong/kubernetes-configuration/api. This package will be removed in
// the future.
