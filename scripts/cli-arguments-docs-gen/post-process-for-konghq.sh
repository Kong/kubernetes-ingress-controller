Learn about the various settings and configurations of the controller can be tweaked
using CLI flags.

## Environment variables

Each flag defined in the table below can also be configured using
an environment variable. The name of the environment variable is `CONTROLLER_`
string followed by the name of flag in uppercase.

For example, `--ingress-class` can be configured using the following
environment variable:

```
CONTROLLER_INGRESS_CLASS=kong-foobar
```

It is recommended that all the configuration is done through environment variables
and not CLI flags.

<!-- vale off -->
' > "${POST_PROCESSED_DOC}"

# Add the generated doc content
cat "${CRD_REF_DOC}" >> "${POST_PROCESSED_DOC}"

# Turn the linter back on
echo "<!-- vale on -->" >> "${POST_PROCESSED_DOC}"
