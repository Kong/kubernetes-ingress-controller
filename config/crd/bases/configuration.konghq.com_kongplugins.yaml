              Ordering overrides the normal plugin execution order. It's only available on Kong Enterprise.
              `<phase>` is a request processing phase (for example, `access` or `body_filter`) and
              `<plugin>` is the name of the plugin that will run before or after the KongPlugin.
              For example, a KongPlugin with `plugin: rate-limiting` and `before.access: ["key-auth"]`
              will create a rate limiting plugin that limits requests _before_ they are authenticated.
