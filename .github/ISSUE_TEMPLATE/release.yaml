    options:
      - label: check the testing workflow ([.github/workflows/test.yaml](/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yaml)) and ensure that all matrix versions ([.github/workflows/e2e.yaml](/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/.github/workflows/e2e.yaml) and [.github/workflows/release.yaml](/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml))  are up to date for various component releases. If there have been any new releases (major, minor or patch) of those components since the latest version seen in that configuration make sure the new versions get added before proceeding with the release. Remove any versions that are no longer supported by the environment provider.
      - label: Kubernetes (via [KIND](https://hub.docker.com/r/kindest/node/tags) and the latest image available when creating a new rapid channel cluster from the GKE new cluster wizard)

    label: "**For all releases** Create Release Branch"
    options:
      - label: "ensure that you have up to date copy of `main`: git checkout main; git pull"
      - label: "create the release branch for the version (e.g. `release/1.3.1`): `git branch -m release/x.y.z`"
      - label: Make any final adjustments to CHANGELOG.md. Double-check that dates are correct, that link anchors point to the correct header, and that you've included a link to the Github compare link at the end.
      - label: retrieve the latest license report from FOSSA and save it to LICENSES
      - label: "ensure base manifest versions use the new version (`config/image/enterprise/kustomization.yaml` and `config/image/oss/kustomization.yaml`) and update manifest files: `make manifests`"

  attributes:
    label: "**For all releases** Create a Release Pull Request"
    options:
      - label: Check the [latest test run](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/actions/workflows/e2e.yaml) to confirm that E2E tests are succeeding. If you are backporting features into a non-main branch, run a [targeted E2E job against that branch](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/actions/workflows/e2e_targeted.yaml).
      - label: Open a PR from your branch to `main`.
      - label: Once the PR is merged, [initiate a release job](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/actions/workflows/release.yaml). Your tag must use `vX.Y.Z` format. Set `latest` to true if this will be the latest release.
      - label: CI will validate the requested version, build and push an image, and run tests against the image before finally creating a tag and publishing a release. If tests fail, CI will push the image but not the tag or release. Investigate the failure, correct it as needed, and start a new release job.
